# hide-and-seek-robot
Overview Many similarities of the hide-and-seek game can be found in the interactions between humans, or robots and humans, in urban spaces, similar to looking for a person in a crowded urban environment (Goldhoorn et al. 2014). It is suggested that the game of hide-and-seek is an ideal domain for studying cognitive functions in robots and it is a basic mechanism for human robot interaction in mobile robotics, because hide-and-seek requires the robot to navigate, search, interact on, and predict actions of the opponent (Johansson and Balkenius 2005).   In this project we demonstrate an ability to program on Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi and communicate between the two systems, program in Python, focusing on OpenCV, and implement deep learning models on the robots to identify faces from purely visual inputs.
